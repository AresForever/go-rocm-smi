# Introduction

This is an unofficial interface to the AMD ROCM SMI library for Golang applications. It is heavily
inspired by [go-nvml](https://github.com/NVIDIA/go-nvml) by also using [cgo](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/)
and [c-for-go](https://c.for-go.com/).

This Golang interface is planned to be used in [cc-metric-collector](https://github.com/ClusterCockpit/cc-metric-collector).
